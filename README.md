# Hibernate and JPA City Data Access Service

This Spring Boot project, "Hibernate and JPA City Data Access Service," serves as a simple demonstration of using Hibernate and JPA (Java Persistence API) to interact with a MySQL database. The project provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing city entities. This README provides an overview of the project and its functionality.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `com.javacourse.project.hibernateAndJpa.DataAccess`: This package contains the core data access class that uses Hibernate and JPA for database interactions.

### DataAccess

- `HibernateCityDal.java`: This class implements the `ICityDal` interface and handles data access operations using Hibernate and JPA. It includes methods for retrieving all cities, adding, updating, deleting, and getting cities by ID.

## How to Use the Service

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Configure the MySQL database connection settings in the application.properties file to match your MySQL database.
Build and run the project using your IDE or Maven:
sh
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Explore the HibernateCityDal.java class to understand how Hibernate and JPA are used for data access.
Use the provided CRUD operations to manage city entities in the MySQL database.
